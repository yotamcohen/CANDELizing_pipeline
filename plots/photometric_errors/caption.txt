In this figure:
(flux error / flux) vs magnitude for various CANDELS filter bands.
The magnitude plotted is the magnitude of the same filter as that for which the error is plotted, not H-band or something.
Light grey scatter points show all the points with PhotFlag==0.
Blue trendline with symbols shows the binned running average of the fractional error.
All data taken from GOODS-N catalog.
All magnitudes in AB system.
